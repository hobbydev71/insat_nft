                  aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with
                  or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by
                  itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We

                          collect information from you, including your browser

                          Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather
                          certain information automatically and store it in log
                          files. This information includes IP addresses, browser

                          referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                          stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information

                          Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to
                          collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of
                          information that a website sends to your computer’s
                          hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may

                          your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay
                          on your computer until you delete them) to provide you
                          with a more personal and interactive experience on our
                          Site. This type of information is collected to make
                          the Site more useful to you and to tailor the
                          experience with us to meet your special interests and

                          Pixel Tag. In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also
                          referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
                          Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique
                          identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are
                          used to track online movements of Web users. In
                          contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s
                          computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly
                          in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail
                          messages in a format users can read, and they tell us
                          whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are
                          sending only messages that are of interest to our
                          users. We may use this information to reduce or
                          eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the
                          information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’
                          Personal Data.

                          different from browser Cookies because of the amount
